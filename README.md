# 4630_ECC_Demo
A simple Elliptical Curve Cryptography example which demonstrates the power of ECC in a simulated mobile device, using a commonly known and secure curve to showcase, encryption and verification.

# How the Code Works and Utilizes ECC

# Key Generation: 
The generate_keys function uses a securely generated random seed to create a private key based on the NIST P-256 elliptic curve. This curve is a part of the standards recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, offering a balance between security and performance.

# Signing a Message: 
The sign_message function takes the private key and a message, and produces a digital signature. This signature demonstrates the sender's (mobile device's) ownership of the private key without revealing the key itself.

# Verifying the Signature:
The verify_signature function uses the corresponding public key to ensure that the signature is valid for the given message. This process is critical for verifying the integrity and authenticity of the received message.
Security Enhancement: By using a secure random seed for key generation and opting for a robust curve like NIST P-256, the script addresses common vulnerabilities associated with weak random number generation and less secure elliptic curves.

# Conclusion
This demonstration shows a basic use of ECC for secure communications in a mobile context, highlighting key generation, signing, and verification, which are central to secure messaging, authentication, and data integrity checks in mobile apps.
